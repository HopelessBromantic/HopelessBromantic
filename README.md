### Homework-Code-Refractor

The objective of this assignment was to simulate consolidation of both html Div elements and CSS targets. Throughout this past week, I had a code consolidation that was functioning very well, but before I could launch it, several changes I made in the CSS caused to completely go haywire and I couldn't see a way to fix it quick without my brain snapping, so I had to start over. With this new code, I feel like it works better in terms of organization than it was before.
